# Interesting Info

### Waveman

**Information from the Website**

Wavman works a lot like many of the other Nostr clients that exist today. It plugs into a relay, pulls events from that relay, and displays them to the user. The main difference is that Wavman is built to consume and present a very specific kind of event we’ve created that contains information about a piece of music: namely its creator, title, and file location (more on this later). Once Wavman has that information, it can display and play a song just like you would expect any music player to.

The more interesting dimension here is that a Nostr user can interact with these events, much in the same way they do today on social media-style Nostr clients. This means users can zap and comment on these songs through Wavman and those interactions will be published and shared for everyone to see. Of course, a developer could easily modify the Wavman client to read from and write to a different relay, or many, or they could change the client to consume a different kind of event entirely… Thinking through the possibilities here gets a bit mind-boggling after a few iterations, which is what excites us most about the development happening on Nostr today.
